## Introduction

* Shapes are good targets of data analysis in many fields, including life science.
* Two dimensional shapes are closed curves in 2D plane and three dimensional shapes are closed curved surfaces in 3D space.
* We propose a method to treat shapes as random number generators.
* Random number generators are to be handled as probability distributions.
* The comparison of shapes are converted to the comparison of probability distributions.

## Methods

### Shapes are random number generators

Assume to pick two random points $X_i,X_j$ from a shape (a manifold).

Let $D_e(X_i,X_j)$ and $D_g(X_i,X_j)$ denote their Euclideian distance and geodesic distance, respectively.

$W(X_i,X_j) = (D_e(X_i,X_j),D_g(X_i,X_j))$ is a random points in 2-dimensional space.

The distribution of $W$ depends on the shape.

### Dimension of Shapes

A closed curve in 2D plane is a shape in 2D.

A closed curved surface in 3D space is a shape in 3D.

The shape dimension can be increased.

### Theoretical approach to 2D shape

A closed curve is parameterized with $t \in [0,1)$, as;

$$
z(t) = (x(t),y(t)),
$$

where $x(0) = x(1)$ and $y(0) = y(1)$ with

$$
x(t) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i^x \sin{(i\times 2 \pi \times t + \psi_i^x)}\\
y(t) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i^y \sin{(i\times 2 \pi \times t + \psi_i^y)}.
$$


#### ???? I believe the distribution of $W$ is analytically given in a formula. ????

Assume t is in the uniform distribution $[0,1]$

$$
t \sim Uniform(0,1)
$$

The infinitsimal length of the curve at t, 
$$
\Delta(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \int_t^{t+\delta} \sqrt{(\frac{dx(t)}{dt})^2+(\frac{dy(t)}{dt})^2} dt,
$$
is the weight of proportinal to the probability density of t, when we generate random points on the curve.

Therefore the probability density of t is,

$$
Pr(z(t)) = \frac{\Delta(t)}{\int_0^{1} \Delta(t) dt}
$$

Therefore, the probability density of point pair $(z(t_1),z(t_2))$ is,

$$
Pr((z(t_1),z(t_2))) \sim Pr(z(t_1)) \times Pr(z(t_2))
$$

This gives the probability density of $W$, where $W(X_i,X_j) = W(z(t_i),z(t_j)) =  (D_e(X_i,X_j),D_g(X_i,X_j))$

Theoretical description will give the relation between "shape" and $W$.

### Application to Data Science

In data science of 2D shapes, we get shapes and we apply the above mentioned theory to the shape data.

Data of shapes are a set of pixels.

The pixels should be converted to discrete broken closed line.

To apply the method to the closed broken line, we can use Fourrier transformation to get coefficients of corresponding trigometric functions.

### Extention to 3D shapes

#### Difficulty in simple extention

As far as I know, the extension of the above mentioned method to 3D shape is not straight-forward.

The Fourrier transformation's extension is the spherization and spherical harmonics decomposition of the functions on the unit sphere can be done as we do.

Unfortunately, the geodesic distance of arbitrary point pairs on 3D shapes is not given from the spherical harmonics decomposition.

Therefore we need to take a different approach.

#### Discretization

2D shapes can be discretized into cyclic graphs.

3D shapes can be discretized into triangular mesh graphs.

We should develop discrete version of distributions $W_{disc}$.

$W_{disc}$ can be obtained by calculating $D_e$ and $D_g$ using random points on the graphs or using vertices when vertices can be considered good representatives of random points.

#### Evaluation of discrete version for 2D shapes

Because we have the analytic method for 2D shape, we can apply the analytic method and discrete method.

We should demonstrate the discrete version distribution, $W_{disc}$, reasonably approximates the analytic method-based $W$.

Also we should demonstrate DEEF's output of a set of $W_{disc}$ is reasonable proxy of DEEF's output of a set of $W$.

## Application of discrete methods to real data sets

After the demonstration of the discrete method's proximity, we evaluate the performance of the discrete version's DEEF-based shape comparison.

The perfomance should be compared with the preceding methods of shape comparison methods.
